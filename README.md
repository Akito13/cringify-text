## Example

**Before:**
> This is a Nim module that takes files as arguments and outputs their respective Fletcher checksum. The Fletcher checksum has a bit lower error detection reliability than for example the well known CRC-32 but it is generally a lot faster than for example CRC-32 as well as Adler-32. The project's goal is to provide a very fast checksum algorithm to be used on devices like the Raspberry Pi.
